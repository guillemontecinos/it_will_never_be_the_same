# It will never be the same, but it will be ok

## About

*It will never be the same, but it will be ok* is a one-on-one music performance created by Guillermo Montecinos inspired in his process of embracing change during his attendance to the School for Poetic Computation in New York. The piece is composed by three musicalized poems which represent three different moments of this process. The listener is encouraged to choose one poem, which is performed in an stripped-down set that allows to engage without distractions and therefore more deeply with the author’s sound portrait of his personal experience.

This piece is performed using a live set composed by a laptop, analog synthesizers, midi controllers, a guitar and pedal effects. The laptop sequences the synthesizers by playing midi scenes which are triggered with a midi controller. It also synchronizes the guitar loop pedal, which is used to build guitar layers, and triggers the poem speech.

*It will never be the same, but it will be ok* invites the listener to travel into a sound trip through the process of self-change experienced after leaving home, feeling alone, growing up and falling in love. It talks about how tough is to quit life by making deep personal changes, but in the end every change leads to new states when things are ok.

The piece was originally performed between November 10th - 12th at SFPC during the 2017 Fall Final Showcase.

## The poems

### I

*It feels so lonely <br>
It feels so weird <br>
I can swim into <br>
A huge sea of nobody*

*It is dark <br>
And it is cruel <br>
But it feels good <br>
Or it seems to*

*Leaving home <br>
Going abroad <br>
Is a way of growing up <br>
But it hurts*

*But it feels good too <br>
It’ll never be the same <br>
But it’ll be ok <br>
And they’ll understand*

*It feels dark <br>
And you deconstruct yourself <br>
But you build a new one <br>
And the sun rises again*

*And it seems to be fine <br>
Because you’re all right <br>
And the wind blows <br>
And the river loves you*

*Cause it’s ok to change <br>
It’s ok to rebuild yourself <br>
They’ll understand <br>
If you’re happy it’s ok*


### II

*It’s ok when you look <br>
With your dark eyes <br>
Into my eyes <br>
It’s not ok, it’s the best I’ve ever felt*

*When you say I like you <br>
And then I love you <br>
And you kiss my soul <br>
And I kiss your shoulder*

*It’s different <br>
And it’s new <br>
It’s sincere <br>
Cause it’s love*

*And you hug me <br>
And it feels like floating <br>
Cause it makes sense <br>
Cause now is the moment*

*It makes sense <br>
And it’s right <br>
If you love me <br>
We can walk ahead*

*If you love me <br>
You can understand <br>
What I’m doing <br>
And what I’m not*

*If you love me <br>
You can go with me <br>
Even if it’s hard <br>
Cause it won’t be easy*


### III

*And it hurts <br>
I know it hurts you <br>
I don’t want to <br>
But it’s the way I feel*

*Cause I changed myself <br>
Cause I’m growing up <br>
But I still love you <br>
Even if it hurts*

*Maybe you won’t understand <br>
But I only feel that <br>
If it makes me feel good <br>
I’ll take it*

*Cause it’s time to break <br>
It’s time to subvert <br>
It’s time improve it <br>
It’s time to make it fly*

*Time to leave away <br>
The guiltiness <br>
The dependency <br>
The fake love*

*Because you love me <br>
And I do too <br>
You must be happy <br>
When I feel good*

*Cause if you’re happy <br>
I’ll be the happiest <br>
It’ll never be the same <br>
But it’ll be ok*
